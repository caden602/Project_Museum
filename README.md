In this discovery and exploration game, you navigate a haunted museum, uncovering the stories of trapped spirits by examining artifacts and gathering contextual items. Each spirit is unique; some communicate directly, while others require contextual clues to engage. Players solve environment-based puzzles across multiple rooms and floors, unlocking items that reveal each spirit's past. A recurring apparition—a young girl tied to a powerful, angry spirit—flashes throughout your nightly explorations, leaving cryptic hints about her fate. By piecing together these clues over multiple encounters, players ultimately face a final choice: release her spirit or keep her bound to the museum.
